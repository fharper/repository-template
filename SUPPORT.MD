# Support

Keep in mind that I created this repository to share code and information with the rest of the world, but I may not have time to support out of my personal needs.

## Issues

If you are having any problem, please create an [issue](/issues/new), and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Pull Requests are welcome, but before doing so, let's discuss about it first in the issue.

## Questions

If you have a question about this project, you can [send me an email](mailto:hi@fred.dev), and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
